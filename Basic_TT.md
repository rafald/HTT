# Initial ideas

**Extentionality** is related to words *behavioral*, *replaceable implemenation*, *data abstraction* - do not look into implementation, abstrat it, the main concern is: can we replace it and still externally observe the same behaviour in scenrious we are intrested in.
Not interested in Intentional properties.
Extentional type theory term is misleading.
